# LinearRegression
Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data.
